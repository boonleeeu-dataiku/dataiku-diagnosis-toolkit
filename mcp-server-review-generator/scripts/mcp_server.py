"""MCP (Model Context Protocol) stdio server exposing this repo's two CLI
entry points -- build_deck.py and validate_deck.py -- as tools for MCP
clients (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, other MCP-capable LLM tools).

Built against the mcp>=2.0 SDK's MCPServer (the renamed successor to 1.x's
FastMCP -- same decorator-based API, see mcp's own v2 migration guide).

Launch directly, e.g. from an MCP client config:
    python3 <repo>/scripts/mcp_server.py

This is a thin wrapper: it resolves the same defaults build_deck.py's own
main() resolves (config/deck_layout.yaml fallbacks, default_output_path()),
then calls build_deck.build_deck() / validate_deck.validate() unchanged.

    checklist workbook, writing it to disk and returning its path.

    Mirrors `python3 scripts/build_deck.py`. Runs the same structural
    validation automatically afterward (see the validate_deck tool) and
    reports any problems found, rather than requiring a separate call.

    Args:
        checklist_path: Path to a completed checklist .xlsx (required).
            A relative path is resolved against this repo's root, not this
            server process's working directory.
        customer: Customer name, shown verbatim (upper-cased) on the title
            slide (required).
        logo_path: Optional path to a customer logo image, spliced into the
            title slide. Omit to leave the title slide without a logo.
        output_path: Output .pptx path. Defaults to
            "output/<Customer_Slug>_Platform_Review_<date>.pptx", where
            <date> is a YYYY-MM-DD found in the checklist filename, else
            today's date.
        rows_per_slide: Max table rows per findings slide. Defaults to
            config/deck_layout.yaml's table_rows_per_slide (4 if unset).
        include_pass_items: Also list Pass/Not-Applicable items in findings
            tables, not just Fail/Partial/Needs Review. If omitted, uses
            config/deck_layout.yaml's include_pass_items (default true).
            Unlike the CLI's --include-pass-items flag (which can only turn
            this on for a run), passing an explicit false here overrides a
            true config default for this call.
        base_deck_path: Base branded .pptx to build from. Defaults to
            "resources/Dataiku Branding Template 2026.pptx".
        style: "v2" (default; the verdict-first ~20-slide storyline: verdict,
            instance snapshot, three risks, quick wins, what we need from
            you, roadmap, then an appendix) or "v1" (one findings slide per
            few items). v2 ignores rows_per_slide/include_pass_items.
        narrative_path: v2 only. Optional narrative.json with the
            human-judgment text (verdict, takeaways, risks, roadmap...).
            If omitted, a file named <checklist_stem>_narrative.json beside the
            checklist is used when present. Every cited ID must exist and its status must support the
            claim, or the call fails with a specific error. Omitted keys
            fall back to text derived from checklist cells.

    Returns:
        A dict with:
          - output_path: absolute path to the generated .pptx
          - structural_problems: list of structural-validation problem
            strings (empty list means the deck passed all automated checks)
          - data_warnings: list of checklist data inconsistencies (e.g.
            section totals that don't match Overall Status Counts, Summary
            rows whose ID/status disagree with the section sheets) -- the
            deck still built, but may show wrong or missing values; fix the
            checklist and rebuild rather than patching the deck
          - manual_qa_checklist: guidance for the manual visual QA pass that
            automated validation cannot perform (only present when
            structural_problems is empty)
          - generator_version: this tool's own version (common.VERSION) that
            produced the deck
          - v2 adds slide_count, narrative_used (path or null),
            narrative_missing (true when no narrative was used; the deck's
            judgment text is then generic, derived from cells) and, when
            missing, narrative_warning, plus applicable_count, pass_count,
