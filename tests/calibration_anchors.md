# Calibration anchors

The title each check id cited in `skills/dataiku-diagnosis-checklist-review/references/calibrations.md` had in the
bundled default checklist when its entry was written. `tests/test_calibration_ids.py` fails when the checklist no
longer matches this table or when `calibrations.md` cites an id missing here; update the entry and the row together.
