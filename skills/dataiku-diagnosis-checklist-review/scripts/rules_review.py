"""Verdict rules for the checks that are always Needs Review (judgment only; see verdicts.py for the contract).

These ask about a live system or a customer practice (groups design, proxy, backups, disaster recovery, a service account, network
connectivity, containerized execution) that a diagnosis bundle can never settle, so the status is fixed. The model still writes
`evidence_found` and `notes`: what the bundle does show, and the `Action:` to confirm the rest (see `references/calibrations.md`).
Each rule's text is the human-readable spec in `references/verdict-rules.md` (keep the two in step)."""
