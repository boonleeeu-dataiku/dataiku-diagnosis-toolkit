# Dataiku toolkit in Codex

Use the task-specific skill in this plugin for the actual review or deck workflow. This companion only translates host-specific instructions that appear in those skills.

- There is no reader MCP server: when the bundle is accessible to Codex's shell, run the reader skill's `scripts/orient.sh <bundle_root>` for triage and `scripts/peek.py` to inspect config JSON. If the bundle is on a separately linked computer and the script file is unavailable there, follow the reader skill's guidance to pipe `orient.sh` to that computer's shell; orient manually only if stdin cannot be passed. Follow its secret-handling guidance on that computer. The review generator MCP server provides `write_summary`, `analyze_checklist`, `build_platform_review_deck`, and `validate_deck`. Discover deferred tools using Codex's available tool discovery mechanism; the literal `ToolSearch` syntax in the original skills is only an example from another host. Use Codex's normal read/search tools for other bundle files, following the reader skill's secret and large-file guidance.
- The checklist skill's `scripts/run_step.py` (run orient/facts, verify the review) runs in Codex's shell like the reader scripts; use it the same way when the bundle is accessible to that shell.
- For checklist workbooks, use Codex's available spreadsheet capability (the `spreadsheets` skill when installed) and `openpyxl` for the original skill's cell-level writeback. The original reference to an `xlsx` skill means a spreadsheet-capable workflow; it does not require a skill with that exact name.
- For a review performed by Codex, write `Codex (AI-assisted review of <bundle name>)` in `validated_by` and identify Codex in the `write_summary` reviewer field unless the user supplied a reviewer name. The checklist skill's verbatim `Claude` label applies to its original host.
- Codex web search has no `extended` mode. For the checklist skill's version-currency lookup, run its two searches with the available web search tool and open the official Dataiku release page to verify the newest GA version. Use the web tool's page-opening action where the skill says `WebFetch`.
- When using the bundled default checklist, resolve `resources/checklist_template.xlsx` from the checklist-review skill's own directory and save the completed workbook to a separate output path outside the plugin directory.
- In Codex, the review generator runs in the local MCP runtime prepared by `scripts/codex-start.sh`, so its tools read paths visible to that runtime. When the diagnosis and checklist are already accessible in the local workspace, use those paths directly. The shared skills' instructions about committing container files to a linked computer apply only when the files are actually on a separate device; make files accessible to the MCP runtime before calling its tools, and copy output back to that device when needed.
- Supply absolute paths for diagnosis bundles, checklists, logos, branding templates, and output files when calling the MCP tools. The review generator otherwise resolves relative inputs from its own server directory.
- Keep customer diagnosis bundles outside the plugin repository.
